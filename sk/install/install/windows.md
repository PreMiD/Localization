The installation of the application is very important as the extension can not do anything by itself.

# Inštalovať
1. Go to our downloads page by [clicking here](https://premid.app/downloads).
2. Choose **Windows**.
3. Open the installer.
4. **Windows SmartScreen** will appear, if you install PreMiD for the first time. Click on **More Info** and then select **Run Anyway**. > This is because we do not have a Code Signing Certificate (CSC). [Support us](https://www.patreon.com/Timeraa) to fund it.{.is-info}

The application will start automatically. Check for the symbol in your system tray.

> Do not forget to [add the **extension**](/install).{.is-warning}
