The installation of the application is very important as the extension can not do anything by itself.

# YÃ¼kle
> There is no official installer for this operating system. This means there is no official support for it. However you can exchange information with other Linux users on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/premid/).{.is-info}

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Open a terminal.
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Timeraa/PreMiD.git`
4. Change the working directory: `cd PreMiD/src`
5. Install the dependencies and the application: `npm install`
6. Change the working directory: `cd ..`
7. Type: `npm run init`
8. Start the application: `npm start`

The application will start automatically. Check for the symbol in your menu bar.

## Arch Linux
If you are on Arch Linux or an Arch based distribution, PreMiD is available on the [Arch Linux Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/premid-git/) (AUR) under `premid-git`. Use your favorite package manager to grab it from there!

## Other distributions
- Installation script: `wget -qO- http://bit.ly/install-premid | bash` or `curl -sL https://bit.ly/install-premid | bash`, wait for it to install, double-click the "PreMiD" shortcut created on your Desktop, and that's it!
- If you want to uninstall PreMiD, you can run `wget -qO- http://bit.ly/uninstall-premid | bash` or `curl -sL https://bit.ly/uninstall-premid | bash`.
