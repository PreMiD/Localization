# General troubleshooting
### 重新加载页面
You can press <kbd>CTRL+R</kbd>/<kbd>F5</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>CMD+R</kbd> (MacOS) on your keyboard too instead of searching for the refresh button.

### Are you using the Discord app?
PreMiD does **not** work on the browser version of Discord, you must download the app [here](https://discord.com/download).

### 请确保您在Discord设置中启用了游戏状态
**用户设置** > **游戏活动** ![gameactivity_edited.png](/gameactivity_edited.png)

### Be sure Discord is running NOT as administrator
这超重要。 Discord RPC will not work if you run Discord as an administrator.

### Are you using a presence with settings?
Many presences (including `Twitch` and `SoundCloud`) are affected by an extension issue. This issue causes the extension to not grab the default values of settings properly.

To solve this, all you have to do is toggle the topmost setting: ![presencesettings.gif](/presencesettings.gif)

### Restart your browser
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> (MacOS) does a good job too. (You have to start your browser again obviously.)

### 重开其 PreMiD (应用)
![quit.png](/quit.png) 之后您需要重开其 Discord

### 刷新/重开其 Discord
Press <kbd>CTRL+R</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>CMD+R</kbd> (MacOS) on your keyboard or restart Discord manually.

### Check if you have antivirus or firewall running on your computer
Sometimes antivirus programs and firewalls are blocking applications which are creating/hosting servers or just connecting to the internet. We are using a local server to receive and pass data between our app and extension, so if you will block app's ability to pass data you probably will not be able to use PreMiD.

### Disable your addons
Disable all your addons and see if it works. If yes, try to enable your addons step-by-step and tell us which addon broke PreMiD.

### Restarting your computer
I hope you know how to restart a computer.

### Reinstalling PreMiD
Sometimes there is something wrong with the files... Tutorials for the installation can be found [here](/install).

### Manual removal
Windows:    `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\`` and delete the folder`PreMiD`.
MacOS:`~/users/USER/~Library/Application Support/`and delete the folder`PreMiD``.

### McAfee detected PreMiD as virus (Windows)
This is a false positive from McAfee and we have reported the issue to them, for now you can exclude PreMiD from the scan by doing the following steps:

1. 打开McAfee应用， 然后在点击右上角的设定按钮。 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rPLZn6c.png" width="500px" style="max-width:100%;" />
2. Click "Quarantined Items" (Second from the top).
3. Expand it, and click the `>` icon before an item with the name "settings.dat".
4. Make sure the path includes "AppData\Local\Temp\PreMiD", if so select it and press restore. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9nvHmiI.png" width="500px" style="max-width:100%;" />
5. After it is restored you can close the "Quarantined Items" popup, then press the settings icon again in the top right.
6. Click "Real-Time Scanning" (Third from the top).
7. Expand it and click "Add file".
8. Type "%appdata%" in the URL bar of the file manager and press Enter. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2bchwLe.png" width="500px" style="max-width:100%;" />
9. Open the "PreMiD" folder and select the "PreMiD.exe" file and click open. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aHOyv3V.png" width="500px" style="max-width:100%;" />
10. McAfee should now ignore our file, just launch our application and you should be good to go.

### PreMiD status bugged on discord!
Don't worry. Just press the <strong x-id="1">ctrl+r</strong> keybind while focused on your discord window to reload it.

# Linux troubleshooting
### Ubuntu/Debian based distros
如果您是通过 Snapcraft下载Discord的，游戏状态将不会显示。 You have to uninstall the Snapcraft version by executing `sudo snap remove discord` on a terminal, download **[Discord's Linux build](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=linux)** (**[or Discord Canary](https://discordapp.com/api/canary/download?platform=linux)**), then navigating to the directory you downloaded Discord to (usually `$HOME/Downloads`), then installing the package using `sudo dpkg -i discord-*.deb`. If AppImage doesn't work, you should consider checking our other packages by **[this link](https://packagecloud.io/premid/linux)**.

### Arch Linux based distros
Arch Linux based distros should use AUR (Arch User Repository) package that is named <code>premid</code> or <code>premid-git</code> (<em x-id="3">WARNING: This repository builds premid from our source code.</em>). If you don't want to install an AUR manager (yay etc.), you can check out our AppImage that is downloadable from our <strong x-id="1"><a href="https://github.com/premid/linux/releases">Linux repository</a></strong>.
<em x-id="3">Warning: the package in the <strong x-id="1">AUR</strong> repository is not maintained by us (as PreMiD organization), but by other people.</em>

### Port binding
You should know that <strong x-id="1">PreMiD</strong> binds itself to the port <strong x-id="1">3020</strong>. This is necessary for the Extension and the Application communicate. If <strong x-id="1">PreMiD</strong> shows you an error about this port, you should check if something is binded to the 3020 port by running <code>sudo lsof -i:3020</code> or <code>sudo netstat -tnlp | grep :3020</code> in your terminal. If some process is binded to it you should make sure to free the port and try running <code>PreMiD</code> again.

### PreMiD's AppImage doesn't launch at login
As we stated in our **Linux repository**, AppImage can't be launched at login. You can add it to autostart manually by doing these steps:
1. Make a file named <strong x-id="1">rc.local</strong> in the <code>/etc</code> directory.
2. Open this file in your favourite editor and paste given code with changing some things:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Required to run as /bin/bash (if you use zsh etc. you can change it.)

# Example: /home/PreMiD/PreMiD*.AppImage
<directory to appimage>/PreMiD*.AppImage

exit 0
```
3. Save file and chmod it as executable `sudo chmod a+x /etc/rc.local`.
4. Restart your PC and PreMiD AppImage should launch at login.

# MacOS troubleshooting
### Error creating directory
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/td92lf6.png" width="300px" style="max-width:100%;" />

If you get this error, it means that your account doesn't have Administrator permissions and you need to create folder manually by doing these steps:
1. Open finder and open **Applications** folder.
2. Right-click on blank space and click **Create folder**.
3. To this folder assign `PreMiD` name (remember about upper-cased letters).
4. Open installer again.
