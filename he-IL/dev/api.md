## API Versioning
> API v2 has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. Please use v3 for any future request to prevent issues.

> {.is-danger}

PreMiD exposes different versions of our API. You can specify version by including it in the request path like `https://api.premid.app/v{version_number}`. Omitting the version number from the route will route requests to the current default version (marked below accordingly).

## Encryption

All HTTP-layer services and protocols (e.g. http) within the PreMiD API use TLS 1.2.
