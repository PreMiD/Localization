## API Versioning
> API v2 has been deprecated and will be removed in the near future. Please use v3 for any future request to prevent issues.

PreMiD exposes different versions of our API. You can specify version by including it in the request path like `https://api.premid.app/v{version_number}`. Omitting the version number from the route will route requests to the current default version (marked below accordingly).

## Kryptering

All HTTP-layer services and protocols (e.g. http) within the PreMiD API use TLS 1.2.
