The installation of the application is very important as the extension can not do anything by itself.

# Zainstaluj
1. Go to our downloads page by [clicking here](https://premid.app/downloads).
2. Choose **OS X**.
3. Extract the archive if necessary.
4. Open the installer.
5. A **security alert** will appear, if you install PreMiD for the first time. Go into your **Preferences** > **Security** > **General** > **Open Anyway**. [Learn more](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac) about unsigned applications.
> This is because we do not have a Code Signing Certificate (CSC). [Support us](https://www.patreon.com/Timeraa) to fund it.{.is-info}
6. Choose open when prompted.
7. Grant access to connections through **Firewall** and control **System Events** when prompted.

The application will start automatically. Check for the symbol in your menu bar.
