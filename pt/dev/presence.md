> All presences are now stored here: https://github.com/PreMiD/Presences 
> 
> {.is-info}

Version `2.x` introduces the [presence store](https://premid.app/store). Users now have the ability to manually add and remove their favourite presences through the user interface of the [website](https://premid.app/).

# Guidelines
> If you do not follow all of the guidelines, your presence or pull request will be deleted off of the github. 
> 
> {.is-danger}

## Creation

Before you begin working on your presence, keep the following list in mind.
- The pull request must be complete, you need to have a proper file structure. Including the `dist` folder, `presence.js` file, and `metadata.json` file.
- The presence **must** be related to the website you have chosen.
- The presence must not be of any illegal websites. These include stressors, drugs, child porn, etc...
- The presence metadata must have well written content, including valid titles, and descriptions.
- The media you include (icon/thumbnail) must be related to the website and should be understandable in terms of size and quality.
- The file structure must be clean and managed, do not have random files which provide nothing to the presence's function.
- The presence **must not** have any malicious intentions. These include stealing/leaking private information, negatively affecting the behavior of the website, etc...
- If you design a presence for a website and the website happens to change in the future, you **ARE** responsible for updating the presence again to work as expected. If you do not fix it within an acceptable time frame, other presence developers are allowed to **overwrite** your presence to comply with the changes.
- The presence must be tested before publishing to confirm that everything works as expected.
- Your presence must have sfw images and descriptions regardless if it is nsfw or not. If your presence is about an `nsfw` website, please add the `nsfw` tag to your metadata.

## Modification

In some situations, presences may behave unexpectedly or could use some minor changes to improve its functionality. Here is a compiled list that you must follow in order to modify presences.
- You are not allowed to change the creator of the presence. This is only applicable if you are allowed to re-write it. You may add yourself as a [contributor](/dev/presence/metadata).
- Make sure the modifications are useful. These may include fixes (code and typos),  additions (descriptions and tags), etc...
- Confirm that your changes work before publishing. Do not create pull requests without knowing the outcome of your changes.
- Do not re-brand/overwrite a presence completely unless permitted by a `Presence Verifier` or staff member.

# Verification
> When you make pull requests about adding or modifying existing presences, you must include a screenshot. However, modifications to a presence's metadata/tsconfig do not require a screenshot. *Your screenshot must be uploaded directly to github with the pull request, do not use third-party image sharing websites.* 
> 
> {.is-danger}

In order for your presence to reach the stores, it must go through a process on github to confirm that it works as expected. Here is a couple of things to look out for when your make your pull request.

Our presence verification team has their own role, look out for `Presence Verifier` on the discord server to know who is involved.

1. It takes two verifiers to confirm that your presence is up to standards. If you happen to get change requests, make the proper effort to fix it or it will not be added.
2. If we request changes and your Pull Request exceeds **7 days of inactivity** without making the necessary ones, we'll be forced to close it.
3. You are allowed to take screenshots of changes made with the help of another user. ( e.g. its author in case you can't access it for any reason).
4. If it is an update or patch, the screenshot must show the new additions working, not any old features from previous pull requests.
5. The provided screenshots should be real, not edited.
6. Any contributed code that gets merged to this repository will be licensed under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0**.


After all of the proper reviews have been met, your pull request will be merged with the store.

# Structure (TypeScript)
You can choose if you want to code your Presence with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) or  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) has some extra spicy type definitions, so fixing and identifying bugs is way easier. If you just want to use [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) you can skip to [Structure (JavaScript)](/dev/presence#structure-javascript).

## Installation
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)).
3. Install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) (open a terminal and `npm install -g typescript`).

## Cloning the project
1. Open a terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/PreMiD/Presences`.
2. Choose a folder of your choice.
3. Open it in you code editor.

## Creating folders and files

1. Create a folder with the **name** (not an URL) of the service you want to support.
2. Create a `presence.ts` and a `tsconfg.json` file inside.
3. Create a folder named `dist` inside.
4. Create a `metadata.json` file inside the `dist` folder.

## Filling in the tsconfig.json file

Please put the following code inside of the `tsconfg.json` file.
```javascript
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/"
  }
}
```
To learn more about TypeScript configuration click [here](/dev/presence/tsconfig).

## Filling in the metadata.json file

Click [here](/dev/presence#filling-in-the-metadatajson-file-2) to see how to fill it in. You will be able to easily click back at the bottom of the explanation.

We've made a `metadata.json` file creator for the lazy peeps [here](https://eggsy.codes/projects/premid/mdcreator).

## Getting started

```javascript
var presence = new Presence({
    clientId: "000000000000000000", //The client ID of the Application created at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
    mediaKeys: false //Enable use and detection of media key presses
}),

strings = presence.getStrings({
    play: "presence.playback.playing",
    pause: "presence.playback.paused"
    //You can use this to get translated strings
});

/*

function myOutsideHeavyLiftingFunction(){
    //Grab and process all your data here

    // element grabs //
    // api calls //
    // variable sets //
}

setInterval(10000, myOutsideHeavyLiftingFunction); 
//Run the function seperate from the UpdateData event every 10 seconds to get and set the variables which UpdateData picks up

*/


presence.on("UpdateData", async () => {
    /*UpdateData is always firing, and therefore should be used as your refresh cycle, or `tick`. This is called several times a second where possible.

    It is recommended to set up another function outside of this event function which will change variable values and do the heavy lifting if you call data from an API.*/

    var presenceData = {
        largeImageKey: "key", /*The key (file name) of the Large Image on the presence. These are uploaded and named in the Rich Presence section of your application, called Art Assets*/
        smallImageKey: "key", /*The key (file name) of the Large Image on the presence. These are uploaded and named in the Rich Presence section of your application, called Art Assets*/
        smallImageText: "Some hover text", //The text which is displayed when hovering over the small image
        details: "Browsing Page Name", //The upper section of the presence text
        state: "Reading section A", //The lower section of the presence text
        startTimestamp: 1577232000, //The unix epoch timestamp for when to start counting from
        endTimestamp: 1577151472000 //If you want to show Time Left instead of Elapsed, this is the unix epoch timestamp at which the timer ends
    }; /*Optionally you can set a largeImageKey here and change the rest as variable subproperties, for example presenceSata.type = "blahblah"; type examples: details, state, etc.*/

    if (presenceData.details == null) {
        //This will fire if you do not set presence details
        presence.setTrayTitle(); //Clears the tray title for mac users
        presence.setActivity(); /*Update the presence with no data, therefore clearing it and making the large image the Discord Application icon, and the text the Discord Application name*/
    } else {
        //This will fire if you set presence details
        presence.setActivity(presenceData); //Update the presence with all the values from the presenceData object
    }
});
```
You can copy this into your `presence.ts` file and edit the values. Setting all the values is done inside of the updataData event.

For examples we suggest to look at the code of presences like: 1337x or 9GAG.

## Can't get certain data?!

A lot of websites are using [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) ([Inlineframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Frames)). These html tags can contain multiple sources such as videos. But they're not relevant every time. Some are hidden or just not actively used. Check if you can extract, the information you need, without them before you do unnecessary work.

1. Check for them by browser console (be sure that you are on the **Elements** tab).
2. Search (<kbd>Strg</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (MacOS)).
3. Execute `document.querySelectorAll("iframe")`.

If you find that your data is in a iFrame you need to do the following:
1. Create a `iframe.ts` file.
2. Set iFrame to `true` in your metadata file.
3. Filling in your iFrame file.
```javascript
var iframe = new iFrame();
iframe.on("UpdateData", async () => {
  /*
  Get all the data you need out of the iFrame save them in variables
  and then sent them using iframe.send
  */
  iframe.send({ //sending data
    video: video,
    time: video.duration
  }); 
});
```
4. Making your presence file receive data from the iFrame file.
```javascript
presence.on("iFrameData", data => {
  iFrameVideo = data.video;
  currentTime = data.time;
});
```
**Note:** This needs to be placed outside of the updateData event.
## Compiling
Open a console in your folder and type `tsc -w` to compile the `presence.ts` into the `/dist` folder.

# Structure (JavaScript)
## Cloning the project
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Open a terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/PreMiD/Presences`.
3. Choose a folder of your choice.
4. Open it in you code editor.

## Creating folders and files

1. Create a folder with the **name** (not an URL) of the service you want to support.
3. Create a folder named `dist` inside.
4. Create a `metadata.json` file and a `presence.js` file inside the `dist` folder.

## Filling in the metadata.json file

# Filling in the metadata.json file
We've made a `metadata.json` file creator for the lazy peeps [here](https://eggsy.codes/projects/premid/mdcreator). It's still suggested to read this through so you know how it works.

```javascript
{
  "author": {
    "name": "USER",
    "id": "ID"
  },
  "contributors": [{
    "name": "USER",
    "id": "ID"
  }],
  "service": "SERVICE",
  "description": {
    "en": "DESCRIPTION"
  },
  "url": "URL",
  "version": "VERSION",
  "logo": "URL",
  "thumbnail": "URL",
  "color": "#HEX000",
  "tags": ["CATEGORY", "TAG"],
  "category": "CATEGORY",
  "regExp": "REGEXP",
  "iFrameRegExp": "REGEXP",
  "iframe": false
}
```

Please copy the code above and put it in your `metadata.json` file. You now need to edit values of the properties. Please note that the following properties are optional to have in your `metadata.json` file, if you do not plan on using them you need to remove them.
- `contributors`
- `regExp`
- `iframe`
- `iFrameRegExp`

# Loading the presence
1. Open the popup and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> button on your keyboard.
2. **Load Presence** will appear in the Presences section.
3. Click on it while you are still holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> button.
4. Select the /dist folder of your presence.

# Some helpful things
## Hot-reloading
The website you are developing on is automatically reloading every time you save a file in your folder.

## Debugging
- You can put `console.log("Test");` between your code and see if your browser console gives you that output. If yes then go on and try again after the next function. If not then there is an error above.
- If that doesn't help you either then ask a presence developer on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PreMiD) for help.
